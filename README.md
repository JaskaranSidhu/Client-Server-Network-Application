# Client-Server-Network-Application

In order to compile the code you can type the following on terminal: “g++ server.cpp –o server” and to run the code type: “./server”. Then you must compile and run the client side with the following: “g++ client.cpp –o client” and to run “./client”.
I am currently using the Linux computers for testing although I do this through ssh. I am using TCP as the transport-layer protocol as with this implementation I do not have to implement a time out feature because there is no packet loss. The code currently has three hashes, although the encryption and decryption of my hash is the only working one. Word sum has a working encryption although it does not print out the correct value to the client console; it only prints the correct values to the server. Sequential index hashing does not work. Overall in my program, the TCP socket programming implementation is all working correctly, my hash for both encryption and decryption is working correctly, the word sum has a working encryption but a broken decryption, and the sequential index hash does not work at all.
